# Virtual Piano
This is a virtual piano program with UI using **x86 Assembly** language.

## Description
This program (hereinafter referred to as **VP**) was designed for the course project of **Microcomputer Experiment**. VP uses the click of keys to sound different tones from Bass 1 to Treble 3 and has corresponding animation when keys are pressed or released.

VP supports free-playing, recording and replaying, which can be selected at the main page of the program. The key-pressing events are recorded and responded using <u>Interruption Module</u> in x86 silicons.

## Usage
To assemble from source code, an assembler is required. The program was tested using MASM 5.0 and functioned normally. Additionally, an emulator will be needed to run the program on a PC with x64 silicon or on a Mac. DOSBox is suggested and can be downloaded at [DOSBox, an x86 emulator with DOS](https://www.dosbox.com).
